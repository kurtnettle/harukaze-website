### What is project Harukze?

<p>
During my university years, I had to develop a dozens of tools in order to streamline various academic task. Most of them were closed-source. However, as my graduation approaches, I decided to make them open-source in order to make them accessible to my university community. With that in mind, the project codenamed "<b>Harukaze</b>" was born.

### Why the name 'Harukaze' ?

I struggled to find a name for the project, then I somehow turned to Japanese words and found one that resonated! It also aligned with the semester name (Spring 2025) I was in, making it feel like the perfect fit!

The word 'haru' (Êò•) means 'spring,' and 'kaze' (È¢®) means 'breeze' in Japanese.
